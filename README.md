## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for built-in fetch API support)
- An active Railway account
- A Railway API token (create one at https://railway.app/account/tokens)


#### Quick Start

This MCP server is designed to work with MCP Clients like:
- Claude for Desktop | ✅ Battle-Tested
- Cursor | ✅ Needs Testing
- Cline | 🚧🔨⏳ Needs Testing
- Windsurf | 🚧🔨⏳ Needs Testing
- Other MCP Clients | 🚧🔨⏳ Needs Testing

### Installing via Smithery

To install railway-mcp automatically, we recommend using [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp)

**Claude Desktop**

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp --client claude
```

**Cursor**
```
npx -y @smithery/cli install @jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp --client cursor
```


<details>
<summary> <h3>Manual Installation For Cursor</h3></summary>

1. Head to your cursor settings and find the MCP section

2. Click 'Add new MCP server'

3. Name it however, you like, we recommend `railway-mcp` for better clarity

4. Paste this command into the 'Command' section, where <RAILWAY_API_TOKEN> is your accounts Railway token:

```bash
npx -y @jasontanswe/railway-mcp <RAILWAY_API_TOKEN>
```
</details>

<details>

<summary><h3>Manual Installation For Claude</h3></summary>

1. Create or edit your Claude for Desktop config file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the railway-mcp server to your configuration with your API token:

```json
   "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jasontanswe/railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
         "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "your-railway-api-token-here"
      }
   }
```

When you have multiple MCP servers, your config file might look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // ... All of your existing MCP servers ...

    // Add the railway-mcp server to your configuration with your API token
    "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jasontanswe/railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "your-railway-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop

4. You can now start using Railway tools directly in Claude. For example:

```
Please list all my Railway projects
```

5. Alternatively, if you don't want to add your token to the configuration file, you can configure it within Claude using:

```
Please configure the Railway API with my token: {YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE}
```

## Recommendations and Other Information
This server best combines with MCP-clients that have access to terminal or with Git **(Cursor, Windsurf)**. Using this MCP with others is recommended as railway-mcp orchestrates containers and streamlines your deployment process seamlessly.

### Recommended MCP servers to combine with
- Git || [Official Link](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git)
- GitHub || [Official](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) || [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github)


### For Claude
- Out of the box, Claude does not have terminal access, so it cannot trigger deployments as it will not be able to get the latest commit.
- Spinning up different services and monitoring them are the best use case with Claude.


### For Cursor
- Use with GitHub MCP or have the repository already setup on GitHub and cloned locally on your machine to leverage full integration with railway-mcp.
- When Cursor makes a change, it may forget to push it's changes to GitHub causing it to try and deploy a commit that Railway cannot pull.
  - **SOLUTION:** Always ask or include somewhere in your prompt: `Have you pushed our changes to GitHub yet?`

## Security Considerations

- Railway API tokens provide full access to your account. Keep them secure.
- When using the environment variable method, your token is stored in the Claude Desktop configuration file.
- Sensitive variable values are automatically masked when displayed.
- All API calls use HTTPS for secure communication.
- The server's memory-only token storage means your token is never written to disk outside of the configuration file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Token Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure your API token is valid and has the necessary permissions
   - If using the environment variable method, check that the token is correctly formatted in the config file
   - Try using the `configure` tool directly in Claude if the environment token isn't working

2. **Server Connection Issues**
   - Check that you've installed the latest version of the server
   - Verify that Node.js version 18 or higher is installed
   - Restart Claude for Desktop after making changes to the configuration

3. **API Errors**
   - Verify that you're using correct project, environment, and service IDs
   - Check Railway's status page for any service disruptions
   - Railway API has rate limits - avoid making too many requests in a short period
